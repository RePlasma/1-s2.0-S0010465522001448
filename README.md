Abstract: _We present a new Monte Carlo code for simulating strong field QED effects in high intensity Laser-Electron collisions, accelerated by massively parallel computations on GPUs. The numerical simulation tool is paired with a separate code which solves the Stratton-Chu vector diffraction integrals given the incoming beam on the focusing mirror, to more accurately describe the electromagnetic field at the focus of the mirror._
